Welcome to my Personal Project for CPSC 210! Sorry for including
the bad joke, but it's kind of my trademark.

### Project Proposal

*Here, I will give a general description of what I seek to
design for my personal project.*

Essentially, I want to design an application that can sort, manage,
and allow the user to keep track of anime/manga/manhwa they've
seen. Ideally, it would have similar functionality to online 
catalogers such as MyAnimeList or Anilist, except that my cataloger
would be a desktop application where the user manually enters
anime/manga/manhwa entries. It should kind of be like a spoof
of the recipe manager application project idea. My target audience 
for this cataloging desktop application would be other people 
who like to watch anime and read manga/manhwa like me.
Many of my friends watch anime and read manga/manhwa, so I thought
it would be a cool idea to make a cataloger and share it with them
if they also wanted to track their reading/watching. 

This project is of interest to me because I love anime/manga/manhwa! 
However, the main reason I want to design my own cataloger with manual 
entries despite also having a MyAnimeList (MAL) is because these online 
catalogers do not include 99% of all **manhwa** (meaning I can't add 
them to my catalogue). Manga and manhwa are both types of graphic 
novels, the difference is that manga is Japanese and manhwa 
is Korean. Manhwa is primarily published online in the form of 
webcomics or webtoons, but MAL has a rule to only include works that
have been physically published. I, myself, primarily only read manhwa
nowadays which is the exact reason why I want to design my own
cataloger and why it interests me so much. Sorry for the small rant!

### User Stories

*Here, I will list some user stories that I would like to add to my 
application. Note that when I say manhwa, I mean any
anime/manga/manhwa.*

- As a user, I want to be able to add a manhwa to my catalog.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of all the manhwa in my catalog.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a manhwa and view its details (title, description, etc.).
- As a user, I want to be able to select a manhwa and rate it based on a 10-point scale.
